             <h4>5 Things You Should Know About Construction</h4>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h5>
                    Here are 5 top things in new and expansion construction our expert panel says you should do to ensure a successful project.
                </h5>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p>1. Perform proper site due diligence</p>
            </div>
        <div>
            <p class="para">
                "Before moving forward with final selection or acquisition of a site for the proposed facility it is important to do a thorough comparative analysis of the various sites under consideration including visibility, access, zoning, utility availability, future growth, cost, configuration and topography, setbacks, and other easements or requirements that affect usable area," says Rustin Becker, vice president advance planning with Madison, Wis.-based Erdman (A Cogdell Spencer Company). "Due diligence should include a formal survey, environmental site assessments and soil borings. Addressing problems that arise from these issues later in the development process can add significantly to projects costs or adversely affect your speed to market."

        </div>

        <div>
            <p>
                2. Seek an architect experienced in your state
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <p class="para">The only thing that's certain when you build is that there will be myriad regulations to meet. But because they vary widely by state, it's important that your architect be well-versed in all the regulations imposed by your state's department of health, certificate of need board (if it has one), building codes and more.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <p class="para">"For example, in Illinois, you are only allowed to spend a certain dollar amount and build to a specified square footage, or else you risk losing your CON," says Mike T. Leopardo, vice president of healthcare construction for Illinois-based Leopardo construction. "Say you want to put an ASC into an existing building, and you have to upgrade the utilities and infrastructure to meet mechanical requirements — all those costs can really push the CON limit, so you need someone who is up to speed, especially as the regulations change."</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <p>
                3. Right-size the facility
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <p class="para">"Many facilities have been designed around conceptual block scheduling or anecdotal utilization, such as 'orthopedics one operating suite, three days a week,'" says Mr. Becker. "Facilities developed in this manner tend to be oversized. Rather, they should be designed around anticipated or actual physician case volumes. Projected volumes should be discounted for factors such as payor contracts, acuity, and scheduling and convenience, then best-in-class ALOS factors and utilization rates should be applied to determine the number of operating suites and support beds needed. Facilities that are right-sized will have the lowest fixed costs, a big factor in positioning the entity for financial success."</p>

        <div>
            <p>
                4. Expect building costs to spiral
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <p class="para">Currently and going forward, it's going to be difficult to use historical cost data to project building costs for any construction project.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <p class="para">"Materials and labor rates in our industry are volatile right now," says Mr. Leopardo. "Every June, with labor negotiations, those rates go up. That's nothing new. But now, because a lot of construction materials are petroleum-based, those costs are spiraling, especially when you factor in the higher cost of transport.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div>
            <p class="para">"Because of this, the time to build is as soon as you can get it built."</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <p>
                5. Design to suit the specialties
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <P class="para">Here are some considerations for building, depending on the specialties that will utilize the facility, from John A. Marasco, principal of Denver-based Marasco and Associates.</P>
        </div>

        <div>
            <p class="para">• Gastroenterology and pain management. "These physicians do not want to deal with the sterility issues associated with a full-fledged, class C OR," he says. "These cases are non-sterile in nature, and treating them as sterile cases only slows down the surgeons, staffs and patients throughput process."</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <P class="para">Accessibility to the OR should therefore not be off of the sterile corridor, but instead directly from the prep/recovery area. If you place this OR between the prep/recovery area and the sterile corridor, rather than on the other side of the sterile corridor, by placing doors into the OR from both the sterile and non-sterile sides, the design lets the OR swing back and forth, depending on the cases that are being performed and what access door remains unlocked.</P>
        </div>

        <div>
            <p class="para">"We call this a swing OR," says Mr. Marasco. "Of course this transition does not occur per case, but instead per surgical block period. For instance, an ophthalmologist may use the operating room in the morning as a sterile environment with the OR swinging in the afternoon to be used by a gastroenterologist as a non-sterile environment. This design technique takes no additional space, allowing a much more flexible ASC."</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <p class="para">• Orthopedics. For more complex orthopedic cases (such as arthroscopies, spine and rotator cuffs), at least a class C, 400-square-foot (preferably 500) OR and plenty of equipment storage should be provided, he suggests.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <p class="para">• ENT. For ENT cases and their pediatric and adolescent patient base, additional privatized recovery stations should be provided.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <p class="para">• Ophthalmology. For ophthalmology cases (primarily cataracts) where several patients are blocked at once before entering the OR, additional prep stations should be provided.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <p class="para">"A little extra space now could save you a lot of headaches later," says Mr. Marasco. "In addition to the above-mentioned design issues, we recommend that any class B operating room (250 square feet —primarily used for minor cases such as gastroenterology and pain management) or above be at least piped with nitrous oxide anesthesia capabilities. All these issues are relatively inexpensive to address during the initial design process and can save you a lot of stress and potentially make you more money in the future when it comes to add specialties or sell to other specialties."</p>
